This tool provides any easy means to create new Visual Studio solutions from an existing Visual Studio solution that serves as a template for other solutions.

After wrestling around with m$'s project template stuff, I had a light bulb moment, realizing that we had WAY overcomplicated matters.

Hopefully, I haven't oversimplified them.

Currently, it prompts the user to input necessary values.

Command line argument support will be added in the next release!

Feel free to roll your sleeves up and dig in!

This is my first open source project and my first time using get hub too.  Slap my wrist as necessary!
